	<h4 class="title is-4">History of Depardment</h4>
	<p>In 1991, the Department of Electronic and Communication was pursued undergraduate courses under Mandalay Institute of Technology, Patheingyi Township of the Mandalay Division.
	In 1997, Department of Electronic and Communication was renamed Department of Electronic Engineering under Mandalay Technological University. 
	In 2000, the Department was located in its own building (Block 11) within the Campus of Mandalay Technological University. The Department has proceeded to increase and develop to meet the requirement of Electronic Science and Technology.
	In 2014, the Department was renovated to fulfill the requirements of Advance Electronic Science and Technology. Within this building, six laboratories with state-of-the-art facilities are being developed for teaching and research.
