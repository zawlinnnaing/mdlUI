	<h3 class="title is-3">Department of Engineering Mathematics</h3>
	<p>
			The Department of Engineering Mathematics is one of the academic departments in Mandalay Technological University (MTU). It is located at building 7 inside the MTU compound. It is obvious that Mathematics plays in a vital role in Engineering and Applied Science. The department provides the Mathematics classes for the undergraduate courses for Bachelor of Engineering programs, and Postgraduate courses for Master of Engineering program and Doctoral programs offered by the Engineering Departments and Bio-technological Department. Moreover, the department also produces research students for Master of Science program and Doctoral program in Engineering Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.
	</p>
	<h4 class="title is-4">Mission & Vission</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>To develop and apply advanced Mathematical methods and ideas to problems arising in engineering methods, engineering science and technology.</li>
			<li>To contribute to society by providing quality education and training in diverse areas of Mathematics and their applications.</li>
		</ol>
	<h4 class="title is-4">History of Depardment</h4>
	<p>The Department of Mathematics was inaugurated on 1st Nov, 1993. Since time immemorial, it was obvious that Mathematics is necessarily needed to contract a developed nation. The leader of Department and all of teachers try their best and their pupils become good engineer. So, the pride of Engineering Mathematics Department is sweet-smelling. Moreover, the gratitude of the former heads of the Department is also immemorial. The former Heads of the Department are U Yin Win Mg, Lecturer, during 1992-1994, U Myint Oo Thar,  Professor, in 1995, Daw Nu Nu, Professor, during 1996-2001,   U Aung Nyein, Associate Professor, during  2001-2004 and Dr. Cho Cho San, Associate Professor, during 2001-2004. Currently, the Head of the Department is Dr. Khaing Khaing Aye, Associate Professor since 2006.

		<ul>
			<li>Functional Analysis</li>
			<li>Numerical Analysis</li>
			<li>Queing Theory</li>
			<li>Partial Differential Equations</li>
			<li>Statistics</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The research application areas of those students are as follows.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Space Research Applications</li>
			<li>Computer Applications</li>
			<li>Water Wave Theory</li>
			<li>Environmental Applications</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>2009-2011</strong>
		<p>In these periods, there are no more research students for Doctoral program and Master program in Engineering Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.</p>
		<p>However, the Mathematics classes required to support the Engineering and Bio-technological programs offered by the Engineering Departments and Bio-technological Department respectively are still available.</p>

		<strong>2012-Up to now</strong>
		<p>Since undergraduate courses for Bachelor of Engineering programs offered by the Engineering Departments are reopened in 2012, the Mathematics classes required to support the Bachelor of Engineering programs are available.</p>
		<p>Moreover, the Mathematics classes required to support the engineering and Bio-technological programs offered by the Engineering Departments and Bio-technological Department respectively are also still available.</p>
		<h4  class="title is-4">Current Academic Research Fields</h4>
		<p>In our department, currently we have only teaching programs for undergraduate and Postgraduate courses as research students for Doctoral programs and Master programs in Engineering Mathematics and Applied Mathematics are not available since 2010. </p>
