		<h3 class="title is-3">Department of Civil Engieering</h3>
		<p>
			The department of civil Engineering has offered undergraduate courses since 1993. The department also offers the post-graduate programme with two specialization fields in water resources engineering and structural engineering for the master degree and Ph.D degree. The educational philosophy of the department emphasise learning the scientific fundamentals of engineering as a foundation for proficient and innovative practice. Interactive classroom lectures are augmented by hands-on laboratory sessions and design and research experience. At the both undergraduate and graduate levels, the students will have an academic advisor from whom the students can seek help in identifying opportunities to enhance their educational experience. Fora sustainable futureas well as forthe advancement of engineering teaching and research, collaboration between the department and industry can also be enjoyed in their student life. Presently, the department has highlyqualified,experienced and dedicated teaching faculty members, actively participating in research and consultancy work. Over a period of time, the department has built up a wide researchpotential. Major area of research in the department  includes; sustainable development, low cost sanitation, water treatment, application of GIS and remote sensing in water resources and environment, vulnerability assessment, seismic analysis  of structures, retrofitting, soil structure  interaction, water resource assessment and management. The department strongly believes in continuous efforts to strive for excellence by exploring new frontiers of knowledge, impacting the latest technical knowledge to the students and conducting high quality research.
