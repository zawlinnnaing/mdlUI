	<p>
		Mechatronics is the synergistic integration of precision mechanical engineering, electronic control and intelligent computer control in the design and manufacturing of industrial products and processes. It is a relatively new concept relating to the design of system, devices, and product aimed at achieving an optimal balance between basic mechanical structure and its overall control.
